            Sometimes I wonder if things would have been different if
            I had understood what coding entailed when I was younger.
            With a lack of exposure in computer science, I understood
            the subject as a career more fitting for the boys – techy,
            computer games, rubik cubes – an all boys club. I know this 
            is quite stereotypical and harmful to think of it in that manner,
            but that was how I perceived the field at that age. It wasn’t
            until years later when I got into college that I  had a glimpse of it.
            As a biology major, I was consumed with courses of organic chemistry,
            genetics, physiology, and labs. But I had a lot of peers that
            were computer science majors, constantly on their laptop working
            on some sort of coding assignment. Lines of colorful code against
            a black background, that I had no understanding of, yet here
            were my peers, working tirelessly to figure out the solution.
            Computer science still looked intimidating as I constantly
            joked that I would never understand what my peers were working
            on.But surprisingly, it wasn’t until my very last year in
            college, did that all change.I had spent all my time thinking
            that I was going to be a researcher, but all the time spent
            in labs and job interviews had me at a crossroad. Did I
            truly want to spend the next 40 years  of my life working
            relentlessly at a research lab, where experiments could
            take months and years to get to a finalized conclusion?
            Research is the one for some people, but not for me
